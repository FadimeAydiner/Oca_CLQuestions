/*
x++ : post increment

In post decrement or increment result is always vsriables first value.
In th≈üs example x=1 then x++ is a post inc. so result=0 but x increase so x is 2.
It is same for decrement to result is varibles first value but variable is decreasing.


++y :pre increment

In pre decrement or increment first variable increase or decrease then result is became variables new value.
In this example y=1 then ++y is a pre inc. so y is increase first y=2 then result is variables new value which is 2 .
